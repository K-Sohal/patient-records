# Patient Medical Records

## Project Overview

### Application Description

The application should assist General Practitioners (GPs) when recording patient information during appointments. By using an efficient and simple application, the GP is able to enter patient details quickly and save valuable time. Additionally, the application allows patients to view their own records and submit any concerns they have. The GP can view these concerns ahead of time and address them during the next appointment.
