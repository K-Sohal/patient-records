# Patient Medical Records

## Project Overview

### Application Description

The application should assist General Practitioners (GPs) when recording patient information during appointments. By using an efficient and simple application, the GP is able to enter patient details quickly and save valuable time. Additionally, the application allows patients to view their own records and submit any concerns they have. The GP can view these concerns ahead of time and address them during the next appointment.

### Project Goals

Design goals:
* Produce a 3 tier application consisting of a SQL database, C# business and WPF GUI layer
* The business layer should be unit tested
* The database should have at least two linked tables
* Project should have concise documentation

User specific goals:
* User authentication system
* GP/patient CRUD functionality
* High usability for data entry
* Data security
