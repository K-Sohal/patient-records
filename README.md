# Patient Medical Records

## Project Overview

### Application Description

The application should assist General Practitioners (GPs) when recording patient information during appointments. By using an efficient and simple application, the GP is able to enter patient details quickly and save valuable time. Additionally, the application allows patients to view their own records and submit any concerns they have. The GP can view these concerns ahead of time and address them during the next appointment.

### Project Goals

Design goals:
* Produce a 3 tier application consisting of a SQL database, C# business and WPF GUI layer
* The business layer should be unit tested
* The database should have at least two linked tables
* Project should have concise documentation

User specific goals:
* User authentication system
* GP/patient CRUD functionality
* High usability for data entry
* Data security

By the end of sprint 1, I aim to have a three tier application with basic functionality and a basic user interface.

#### Sprint Goals

- [x] Complete user story 0.1
- [ ] Complete user story 0.2
- [ ] Complete user story 0.3
- [x] Complete user story 0.4
- [x] Update read me file
- [x] Create local git folder
- [x] Commit all changes from local to github
- [x] Complete agile retrospective

#### Sprint Review

Documentation and database design was completed. The create and delete functionality of the business layer was implemented. The update functionality needs to be added to the business layer, also the business layer needs to be unit tested. The GUI needs to be created.

#### Sprint Retrospective

Not all user stories were completed, in part due to limited time this sprint because of a test. Additionally, I got carried away with the database design by adding features that were not priority. This increased the complexity of the design and therefore increased the time taken to develop the database and the business layer. The GUI looks like it will take a lot of time and is a large part of the project due to the database having many tables. Therefore user story 0.2 - Create a GUI should be broken down into sub tasks as this will most likely take more than one sprint to complete.
